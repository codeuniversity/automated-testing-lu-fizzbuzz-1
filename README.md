# Automated Testing LU FizzBuzz

Are you here because you are taking part in the LU?

Please open: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/codeuniversity/automated-testing-lu-fizzbuzz-1/blob/main/fizzbuzz.py

Then, follow the instructions given in the workshop, and the following, by opening `fizzbuzz.py`:

```python
# KEEP THE COMMENTS SO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO

# DO NOT EDIT THIS FUNCTION
def fizzBuzz(n):
  # DON'T EDIT THIS, ADD TESTS BELOW
  pass
# DO NOT EDIT THE LINES ABOVE

# Test the fizzBuzz function, assuming it:
# 1. accepts a number as a first parameter
# 2. returns that exact number as a string, unless
## - the number is divisible by 3, in which case it returns "Fizz"
## - the number is divisible by 5, in which case it returns "Buzz"
## - the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, in which case it returns "FizzBuzz"

# ADD YOUR TESTS HERE
